# Malware-detection-and-classification-using-image-processing
in this project, we used image processing Techniques to classify 9 class malware our final goal is to reach an appropriate model with high accuracy and small size and computational cost

## Dataset
we used BIG2015 dataset available in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data) \
this dataset contains different kinds of information about these 9 classes, here we used .bytes files and converted them to images that can be used by image classification methods. images are 256*256 in size and are single chnanel.
