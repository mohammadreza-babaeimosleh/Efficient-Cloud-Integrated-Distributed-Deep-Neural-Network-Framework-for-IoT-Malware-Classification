# Malware-detection-and-classification-using-image-processing
in this project, we used image processing Techniques to classify 9 class malware our final goal is to reach an appropriate model with high accuracy and small size and computational cost

## Dataset
we used BIG2015 dataset available in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data) \
this dataset contains different kinds of information about these 9 classes, here we used .bytes files and converted them to images that can be used by image classification methods. images are 256*256 in size and are single chnanel.

## requirements
to install requirements of project run code below in your command line
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Codes Description
Within this repository exists a subdirectory titled **byte_to_image** which encompasses code designed to preprocess your **.byte** data into images of a specified size, specifically **256 * 256** in our particular scenario.

Certain codes are associated with the preparation of data, which is applicable to both local and on-board settings.

The aforementioned codes encompass distinct models that have been trained on four distinct types of datasets: raw datasets, augmented datasets utilizing SMOTE methods and resampling, datasets enhanced solely through SMOTE methods, and datasets augmented solely through resampling. It is worth noting that several models showed improvements, as indicated chiefly by their respective titles. The many models in our study include **ResNet-101, ResNet-50, ResNet-18, MobileNetV2, MobileViT, and SqueezeNet**, along with their enhanced and adapted iterations. In the subsequent section, one may locate several codes pertaining to our distinct variant of the Hierarchical model, commonly referred to as the pipeline. Within these codes, we have employed the aforementioned models discussed before in order to achieve optimal runtime and resource utilization, all while upholding accuracy.

**Note**: Please be advised that in order to speed up the training process, it is recommended to utilize **cuda**. Failure to do so may result in a significantly longer duration for the training process to complete.
